# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# 5. Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

# index = 0
# while index < 10
#     puts 9000
#     index = index + 1
# end

# 6. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number 
# and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

# puts "Enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# while number < 10
#     puts "Enter a number: "
#     number = gets.chomp.to_i
# end

# 7. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

# number = 50
# while number <= 70
#     puts number
#     number = number + 1
# end


#8. Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

# index = 0
# while index <= 144
#     puts "Around the world"
#     index = index + 1
# end

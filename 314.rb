# QUESTION 1
# Ancay ouyay igurefay histay neoay utoay?
# Pig Latin is a very sophisticated language in which 
# each English word is converted as follows: 
# The first letter of each word is removed from the beginning and added to the end. 
# Then, the letters 'ay' are added to the very end of the word.
# For example: hello = ellohay, pingpong = ingpongpay, marmalade = armalademay, etc.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a single word 
# and prints out the Pig Latin version of that word.

# Take a string from the user
puts "Give me a word"
word = gets.chomp
# Maybe throw the string into an array
word = word.split (//)
pp word

# Take the first letter of the string in the array

# PUsh the first letter or 0 placement of the string/array to the end of the word or string

# Join the word together again .join

# Have code grab the given word and + "ay"

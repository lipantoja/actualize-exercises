# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# 8. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number with decimals, then prints the number as an integer. 

pi = 3.1425
puts pi.to_i

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
#   Was able to do this easily, able to do first try. Will continue to do variables as an exercise for
#   this portion, will start working on other areas in deliberate practice.
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

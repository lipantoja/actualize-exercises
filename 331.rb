# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
    # was difficult at first but was able to work through it. will be working on loops and redoing loops for awhile


# 1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

index = 0
number = 0

while index < 10
    puts number = number + 1
    index = index + 1
end

# 2. Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

index = 0
word = "hello"

while index < 5
    puts word
    index = index + 1
end

# 3. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a 
# word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

puts "Enter a word:"
word = gets.chomp

while word != "stop"
    puts "Enter a word:"
    word = gets.chomp
end

# 4. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, 
# increasing by 5 each time.


number = 0

while number < 100
    puts number = number + 5
end

# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
    # It almost feels like I did not at all learn about methods. I think methods are goint to take the most practice for me.


# 1. Write a method that takes in a number and returns 
# the number times two. 
# Then run the method and print the result.

def double(number)
    return number * 2
end

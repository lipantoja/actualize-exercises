# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# 5. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, 
# then prints the number times 10.

number = 20
puts number * 10

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
#   Was easy to do, just made a spelling mistake on "puts" and forgot the 's'
#   I think what I'd like to do is follow every problem in this 01-variables page, even if I'm confident in it.
#   I believe it will become much harder when I we reach loops
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

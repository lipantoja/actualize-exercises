# QUESTION 1

# Then write a program that uses the select method with an array of strings 
# to create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "a".

array = [
    "This is a string√ü",
    "Another one",
    "Absolutely stunning",
    "Bear and the Big Blue House",
    "Aaaadventure Time"

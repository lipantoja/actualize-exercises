# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# 02-conditionals
# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that 
#    prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

number = 10
if number == 10
    p 0
else
    p -1
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
#  Was easy to remember besides not adding an "end" at the very end.
#  Would like start on item 10, as it seems more complex next time in this same list of conditionals
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

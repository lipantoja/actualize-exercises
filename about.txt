My name is Laura Pantoja. I am currently working for a non-profit hospice as their compliance coordinator.
After a lot of thinking and searching the pandemic, I had realized now was the time to take a chance and learning something new.
Realizing my future goals and aligning them with my interests while also practicing come coding languagues on my own, 
I realized software development was the best fit for me.
While I am currently unsure what exact path to take in software development, I enjoy the oppertunity to problem solve, be creative,
and constantly learn more material. If I was able to find the ideal work place, I would love to work for some sort of art, music, or non-profit type of company.
With my work now, I currently am interested in electronic medical records and how I could be of a support to the 
growing issues and national, state requirements asked of hospitals, hospices, and other health related organizations.

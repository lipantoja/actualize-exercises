# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# 1. Create an array to store 3 words. Then add two more words to the array and print the array on one line.

array = ["Hello", "there, ", "World"]

# puts array.insert(3, "I " "am " "Laura.")

# array << "I'm " "Laura."
# puts array


#2. Create an array to store 4 letters. Then change the second letter to a number and print the array on one line.

array = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
array[1] = 12
puts array

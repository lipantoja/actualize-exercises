# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
    # I'm excited I think this is good practice for me, need to play with methods more.
    # Realize I'm more familiar with the other tools because I've studied other languages in the past.
    # I want to stay here and pratice more methods, I think other concepts make sense to me and will just take repetition


# Write a method that takes in a string and returns the string 
# with all capital letters. Then run the method and print the result.

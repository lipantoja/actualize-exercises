# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
    # These questions were relatively easier the move I play around with them. 
    # I do wish doing practice multiple times on basic and maybe simplier concepts such as these
    # was mandatory in the curriculum opposed to option on how much is done


# 9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word 
# and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

# puts "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp.to_s

# while word.length <= 5
#     puts "Enter a word: "
#     word = gets.chomp
# end


# 10. Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.

# number = 0 
# while number <= 40
#     number = number + 2
#     puts number
# end

# 1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
# For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.

# numbers = [3, 5, 6, 10]
# number = 0
# index = 0
# while index < numbers.length
#     number = number + numbers[index]
#     index = index + 1
# end
# pp number

# 2. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string.
# For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "volleyballbasketballbadminton"

# musicals = ["Hamilton", "Hadestown", "Wicked"]

# puts musicals.join

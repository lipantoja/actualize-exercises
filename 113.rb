# QUESTION 1
# Write code to store 3 different numbers in three different variables.
# Then write the code to print the three variables added together.
first_number = 1
second_number = 5
third_number = 42

puts first_number + second_number + third_number

# QUESTION 2
# If you run the code below, it will crash due to invalid variable names. 
# Find the invalid variable names and delete the special characters 
# (be sure to leave the special characters in the valid variable names alone).

bob7 = 50
#invalid syntax error -  doesn't like number in first part of variable
#invalid, without identifiers- seems this symbol at the end of the variable is not allowed
@bob = 50
bob_ = 50
_bob = 50
#invalid, without identifiers- seems this symbol at the end of the variable is not allowed
$bob = 50

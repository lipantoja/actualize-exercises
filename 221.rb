# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# 6. Write a program that uses variables to store two words, 
# then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters

fruit = "apple"
drink = " juice"

fresh = fruit + drink
puts fresh.upcase

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#   It was was easy to pull the components I needed from memory, but forgot how to print on the same line without making the two strings a new variable
#   I'm going to have to remember I can do the same action in the "fresh" variable but just in the 'puts' line

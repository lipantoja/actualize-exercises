<!--In your actualize-exercises repository, make a file called 523.css.
(Note: be sure to name the file with a .css extension!)

Then write the CSS to customize the <h1> element's color, background color,
and font properties. Feel free to customize other properties as well!

To view the styled HTML, use the terminal to run the command open 523.html.

Use the terminal to commit your code and push your changes to GitHub.
